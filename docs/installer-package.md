# Maestro installer package contract

The visual wizard is only an interface. A real user-space installer package
must carry the exact trust-bearing inputs that the bridge is authorized to
consume:

- the native `maestro-installer` bridge for the target macOS architecture;
- the exact signed release directory;
- the approved authority registry;
- the independently signed native `bcgos-bootstrap` seed;
- the deterministic wizard tree and approved Maestro `.icns`.

`dev/release/build-macos-installer.sh` packages those inputs into
`Maestro Installer.app` and an unsigned DMG. It rejects missing or symlinked
inputs, checks the requested architecture with `lipo`, validates the release
manifest identity against the requested version, re-hashes every staged
bridge/registry/bootstrapper/icon input, records file/tree digests and passes
explicit paths to the bridge. The bridge therefore keeps its normal per-user
managed and owner-data roots without requiring administrator permission or
changing the global `PATH`.

The output is deliberately marked `unsigned-candidate`. Its provenance record
also includes the release manifest and detached-signature digests. The script
does not
create keys, sign bytes, notarize the app, contact a provider or weaken the
bridge's release verification. Developer ID, notarization, Ed25519 authority,
provider publication and clean-device acceptance remain protected release
gates.

The separate `dev/release/maestro-rehearsal-dmg.sh` remains the safe local
technical rehearsal: it launches `--simulate` and contains no signed release
inputs. Do not use the rehearsal artifact as a production installer.
