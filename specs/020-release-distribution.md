# Spec 020 - Release distribution

Status: accepted contract; packaging, production signing, provider
authentication and activation are separate implementation tracks.

## Objective

Make one Maestro release verifiable and portable across artifact providers
without coupling trust to a GitHub owner name. Pilot users consume releases;
they never clone or update the product through Git.

## Release authority

The release manifest is the portable authority for a release set. It names the
Maestro product, immutable release and component versions, compatibility,
artifact identities, detached signatures, migrations and release notes.

The detached manifest signature must be verified against an approved local
issuer/key registry before its fields are trusted. Parsing a manifest,
validating JSON or comparing a checksum does not establish signature trust.
The manifest issuer is a Maestro identity and key ID, not a repository URL.

`schemas/release-authority-registry.schema.json` defines that local trust root.
It contains public Ed25519 keys only, scoped to the Maestro product and an
issuer/key identity. Each key has a bounded UTC validity window and is either
active or explicitly revoked. Unknown fields, duplicate JSON keys, duplicate
issuer/key identities, non-canonical public keys and invalid status/time
combinations fail closed. A future or expired key remains in the inspectable
registry but cannot verify a release.

Private signing keys, certificate material and custody operations never enter
the registry or repository. The stable bootstrapper must receive the approved
registry through its independently signed seed channel; a managed bundle or
provider response cannot replace the trust root that authenticates it.

The release provider is an adapter. GitHub private Releases is the pilot
provider, but provider responses cannot add, replace or rename artifacts after
manifest verification.

## Components

- The stable bootstrapper owns installation and activation. It is not
  self-updated by the first release contract.
- The `bcgos` CLI is a platform-specific executable with its own version and
  compatible bundle range.
- The base bundle is one platform-neutral, immutable archive containing only
  reviewed managed product content.
- Optional runtime packs remain a separately versioned future extension.
  Manifest v1 intentionally excludes them until their identity, compatibility
  and migration model is specified. Docling belongs in that future runtime
  pack rather than the thin CLI or base bundle.

CLI and bundle versions are independent. A release is valid only when the
declared current versions accept each other. Update planning must also prove
that each intermediate activation state is compatible.

## Manifest v1

`schemas/release-manifest.schema.json` defines the structural JSON contract.
`internal/releasecontract` is the normative semantic validator for rules that
JSON Schema cannot express:

- exact canonical `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions;
- closed-open compatibility ranges using `>=A.B.C <X.Y.Z`;
- mutual compatibility of the current CLI and bundle;
- at least one CLI artifact and exactly one platform-neutral base bundle;
- unique artifact names, signature references and kind/platform tuples;
- basename-only references with no traversal, mutable `latest` aliases or
  local/workspace paths;
- lowercase SHA-256 digests and detached `.sig` references;
- migration targets that match the declared component version and are outside
  the source range.
- the `practice-agent-to-pa-expert` migration, when present, pins its bounded
  source/expiry versions and the exact bundle, agent-catalog and agent-policy
  SHA-256 identities.

Strict parsing rejects unknown fields, duplicate object keys, oversized input
and trailing JSON values. CLI and bundle artifact names contain their component
version. V1 has no silent compatibility fallback and no runtime-pack entries.

The manifest wire files are exactly `release-manifest.json` and
`release-manifest.json.sig`. The signature is a raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature
over the exact manifest bytes as downloaded; there is no JSON reserialization
or whitespace normalization before verification. An implementation may parse
only `issuer.id` and `issuer.key_id` as untrusted routing hints, selects a key
only from its approved local Maestro release-key registry, verifies the
signature, and only then trusts or semantically validates the manifest fields.
Every artifact `.sig` likewise signs the exact artifact bytes.

A release version is globally immutable across channels. Promotion from
`canary` to `beta` or `stable` requires a new release version and a newly signed
manifest. Publication state must reject reusing a release version with another
channel or changing the manifest bytes behind an existing version.

## Distribution boundary

Allowed release content is selected through an explicit factory allowlist.
Repository copies, globbing the entire bundle tree and generated source
archives are not product bundles.

Releases may contain code, official skills, sanitized templates, schemas,
policies and runtime adapters. They may never contain:

- source development harnesses or contribution hooks;
- credentials, tokens, signing keys or provider responses;
- user preferences, memory, logs or local configuration;
- workspace metadata, case content, client data or personal data;
- caches, Git history or unreviewed generated files.

Factory validation must reject symlinks, traversal and an allowlisted file that
changes type.

## Release states

An unsigned deterministic output is a **release candidate**, not a pilot
release. A pilot release additionally requires:

1. manifest and artifact signatures from approved production identities;
2. native Windows and macOS signing/notarization evidence;
3. authenticated private-provider publication;
4. install, update and rollback acceptance on clean corporate Windows and
   macOS devices.

Missing authority is reported as `unavailable`; no production command accepts
an unsigned override. The existing unsigned trial acknowledgement remains
confined to `installers/trial`.

## Acceptance evidence

- Schema and Go semantic validation agree on every v1 example.
- Tampering with the manifest, artifact bytes or signature fails closed.
- CLI and bundle compatibility is observable independently.
- Deterministic packaging excludes every non-allowlisted path.
- Release notes disclose capability gaps and migration requirements.
- Validation distinguishes candidate build, signed publication, local
  installation, operator-attested device evidence, approved corporate-device
  acceptance and pilot readiness.

The `0.2.0` release opens the bounded role-migration boundary. An update from
`0.1.x` must carry that signed migration evidence; releases that still accept
such an installation carry it as well. After the boundary, legacy practice
roles and IDs fail closed. Install state carries the migration identity and
rollback refuses to reactivate a legacy authority without a canonical PA
Expert binding.
